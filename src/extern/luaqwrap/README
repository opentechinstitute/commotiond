LuaWrap an API wrapper for Lua
Copyright (c) 2014, Luis Enrique Garcia Ontanon

LuaWrap is a code generator to create Lua bindings for C APIs.

luawrap.lua parses the original file (.lw) copying it into its outfile
looking for "LW directives" in comments and replaces them with the
appropriate C code.

The .lw file is C with special #preprocessor lines that are called directives.

LuaWrap directives are:


#Module <name> [mode="static"|"extern"]
   Defines the name of the module to be added to the global namespace and sets
 in which mode luawrap is to operate (defaults to 'static'), it must be the
 first LW command in the file.

   In 'static' mode it parses and generates a single .c file and all functions
 are created static.

   In 'extern' mode the main file is seed to a .h and tells which .lw files are
 to be used for generating .c files, functions (apart from methods) are extern.




#Class <name> <type>
#OwnClass <name> <type>

   These define classes to be added to the Lua interface, the name must start with
 a capital and contain only letters, the type is the type of object it points to.
OwnClass declares only the "primitives" (pushX,checkX,optX,...) leaving up to you
to define them while Class defines them as well.

the "primitives" are:
 * toXxx(L,idx) gets a Xxx from an index (Doesn't throw if fails)
 * checkXxx(L,idx) gets a Xxx from an index after calling check_code (throws on fail)
 * optXxx(L,idx,dflt) gets an Xxx from an index, dflt if it is nil or unexistent 
 * pushXxx(L,xxx) pushes an Xxx into the stack
 * isXxx(L,idx) tests whether we have an Xxx at idx
 * shiftXxx(L,idx) removes and rets an Xxx from idx only if it has a type of Xxx, rets NULL otherwise
 * dumpXxx(L,idx) returns a cheap string representation of the Xxx at pos idx 

for each class (X) you have to define three functions:
 void X__push(X*);  // to be called when pushing an object into Lua
 void X__check(X*); // to be called to check an object (throws if invalid)
 void X__gcoll(X*); // to be called by the __gc
LwDefinePushDummy(Xxx) and LwDefineChkDummy(Xxx) and LwDefineGCollDummy(C) might help



#Function: <name> <function-name>: <return-list> @ <arguments-list>
 These define functions for which code is to be generated.
 <name> can be in either:
        "ClassName.method_name" for a method,
        "ClassName.__meta_name" for a metamethod
        "function_name" for funtions not belonging to any class.
 
 <function-name> the function arround which this call is being generated. 
        For obvious reasons this should appear after the prototype of the
        function whose argument names will be used in the sythesis.
 
 <return-list> the return values of the function (and how to get them)
 
 <argument-list> the argument list of the function (and how to get them)
  
 return-list is made of a sequence of the following "elements":
   - N{name} a number 
        name is the varname that will contain it use _ for the return value
   - B{name} a boolean
   - S{name} a string
   - L{name;len_name;bufsize} a lstring
        len_name is the var that contains the lenght
        bufsize the size of the buffer used to temporarily hold the output
   - Name{name;ref} an object of class "Name" or a Callback of type "Name"

elems in argument-list can be:
        N{name;type;default} a number
            - name the name of the variable
            - type the optional type of the object (defaults to ``double'' )
            - default an optional default value
        B{name;default}, a boolean
        S{name;default}, a string
        L{name;len_name;len_type"}, an lstring
            - len_name is the name of the var that contains the length
            - len_type is the optional (dflt: size_t ) type for the var
        Name{name;arg2}, either an object or a CallBack function
          - arg2 default for object, key_name for callback
        X{name;value;type} a pseudo-argument 
          these are used to manipulate values in the definition of the function/callback
        K{name,key} a key for a callback (given in the same order as the CB before)
          - name of the variable
          - type of key generator
          
 Function Examples:
    int co_list_contains(co_obj_t *list, co_obj_t *item);
    //LW: Function List.contains co_list_contains: B{_} @ List{list} Obj{item}

    size_t co_list_import(co_obj_t **listp, const char *input, const size_t ilen);
    //LW: Function List.import co_list_import: List{list} N{_} @ L{input;ilen} X{listp;&list;co_obj_t**}
    
    size_t co_list_raw(char *output, const size_t olen, const co_obj_t *list);    
    //LW: Function List.raw co_list_raw: L{output,olen;4096} @ List{list}
    
 [[ a whole chapter about manipulation is missing here ]]


#Accessor <name> <mode='RO'|'RW'>: <return-list> @ <arguments-list>
    $name ==> ((X*)ptr->)name
    TO DO


#CallBack <name>[{key}] <type-name> <mode:'key'|'closure'>:  <return-list> @ <arguments-list>
   ...


#Alias <name-1> <name-2> (NYI)
  Creates an alias called <name-1> to the function called <name-2>
<name-1>,<name-2>
        "ClassName.method_name" for a method,
        "ClassName.__meta_name" for a metamethod
        "function_name" for funtions not belonging to any class.


#ProcFile <in-file> [out-file] (NYI)
    Process another file in the same batch
    <in-file> use this file as input
    <out-file> if mode is 'extern' the output of this lwfile will go to this file,
               instead of the main output one, error if "static"

#Finish <register-function-name>
   Adds the  registration function (that is later invoked by Lua to create the classes)

   <register-function-name> name given to the registration function




LuaWrap is directly derived from the code used to add Lua to
Wireshark, and authored by the same person.
